### Motion Planning in a 3-arm Robot <br>

The python file `Assigment 4 Starter Code.py` contains the code to run the `RRT` and `RRT-Star` algorithms for finding a path to the goal position. <br>

The function `RRT.plan()` performs RRT algorithm for finding a path. The function `RRT.plan2()` performs RRT-star for finding a path. <br>
On line `314` of `Assigment 4 Starter Code.py` one can call `rrt.plan()` or `rrt.plan2()` depending on which algorithm one wishes to run. <br>
